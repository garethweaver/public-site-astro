I led a project to create a working prototype of an online repository
for members of Uniliver's Consumer Market Insight group. Users were able to access
concept adverts from all strands of Uniliver's business. The project was a Ruby
based Angular app built in CoffeeScript and Haml. Users of the app were able to
search, collect and test concept adverts all within the app.
