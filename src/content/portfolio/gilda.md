A simple static brochure page to showcase Nexus’ latest augmented reality
project. As the site did not require a framework, modules were written in ES6,
Sass, and HTML. Partials and modules were compiled and bundled with Webpack
prior to depolyment with static data rendered via Handlebars. Simple user
interactions with minimal animations gave the site a really nice clean finish.
