  title: Gareth Weaver - I built this with AstroJs and React
  description: I rebuilt my personal website in React using AstroJs and learnt
    a lot along the way. Previously it was built in both GatsbyJs and AngularJs.

My portfolio is built with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AstroJs</a>. I first put my portfolio site together in
2016 using Angular@1.3.0 and Middleman. since then I've rebuilt it with GatsbyJs in
2018 and again in 2023 with a design facelift.

I'm a big fan of AstroJs' island architecture and the control one has over
delayed hydration on the client. At the time of writing this no other framework is
offering such great control over how much javascript is shipped to the client.

You can find all the repositories here:

* <a href="https://github.com/garethweaver/public-site-gatsby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GatsbyJs@2.0.0 - GatsbyJs@4.0.0 \[2018\]</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/garethweaver/public-site-angular" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular@1.3, Middleman \[2016\]</a>
