A personal project to show team and league results for the In2Touch rugby
leagues in London. A node script deployed to Heroku scrapes data from the rather
dated In2Touch website and saves it to a realtime Firebase database.

The frontend is built in React using a Redux store. Data is cached locally to
reduce server load and allow offline app usage. Currently the app isn't deployed
to an app store but can be added to homescreen.
