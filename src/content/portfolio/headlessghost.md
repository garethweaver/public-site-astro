When running a Kickstarter it's never a bad idea to throw up a
microsite to promote your campaign or project. I designed this microsite to be
big and bold while encouraging people to get involed and fund the project. Headless
Ghost mimics a high resolution display unit for headless machines for GPU accelerated
remote desktop and crypto currency mining.
