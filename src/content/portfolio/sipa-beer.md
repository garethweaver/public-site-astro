  description: A rushed project for my brother to design a label for his first
    brewed beer
---
During lockdown my brother brewed his first beer, an ambitious sourdough IPA. I
don't profess to be a designer but sometimes I like to try my hand at it with mixed
results. With a 48h turnaround we managed to get this label to print. The beer
tastes pretty good to be fair to him, I hope he keeps me in stock.
